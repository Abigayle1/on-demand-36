On Demand Business Plan
Executive Summary
On Demand is a digital platform designed to connect customers with vocational workers in Jamaica quickly and efficiently. Unlike traditional freelancing platforms, On Demand operates similarly to Uber, matching job requests with available professionals in real time, reducing the hassle of searching for skilled workers. Our Capture & Describe feature allows customers to provide detailed descriptions and images of their issues, helping workers assess jobs before accepting them.
Targeting Jamaica's growing need for skilled labor, On Demand aims to streamline job matching in industries such as plumbing, electrical work, appliance repairs, and construction. Our key differentiators include speed, efficiency, and verified professionals, ensuring high-quality service delivery.
Industry Overview
On Demand operates within the vocational service industry, a sector that is largely fragmented and dependent on word-of-mouth referrals. Competitors include traditional classified ads, social media groups, and local trade directories, but these solutions lack the instant matching, trust verification, and seamless payment integration that On Demand offers.
Jamaica has a strong demand for on-call vocational services, but existing solutions are slow and unreliable. Our model leverages technology to bridge the gap, providing a scalable and automated solution to a pressing need.
